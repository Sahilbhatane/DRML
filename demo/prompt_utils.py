REFLECT_USER_PROMPT = '''Suppose you are a frontend designer working with a code agent to implement an HTML webpage. You are provided with two images: the first image is the webpage you are hoping to produce, and the second one is the current implementation from the code agent. Note that images have already been replaced with blue rectangles as the placeholder.

Your job is to carefully compare the code agent's implementation against the intended webpage, and provide feedback to help the code agent make its implementation closer to the indended webpage. Your feedback should be specific to the differences in layouts and visual components on the two webpages. Please note that the code agent **DOES NOT** have access to the intended webpage, so you make sure to describe the intended visual components and where exactly the agent got wrong, instead of saying something like "refer to the format of the intended webpage". You should prioritize making sure that the code agent understands the correct layout before giving out any styling advice.

Limit your feedback to a single sentence.

You may compare and analyze the two webpages step by step. Once you are ready, your final feedback using triple quotes:
Feedback: """
{{YOUR_INSTRUCTIONS_HERE}}
"""

If you think the current implementation is close enough to the intended webpage, please output "Generation Complete" as your feedback. I.e.,
Feedback: """
Generation Complete
